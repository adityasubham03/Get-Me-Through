Cloning tensorflow repository. -- TensorFlow model Garden.

Tensorflow MG or Tensorflow.js

Alternative ?? YOLO NAS --- good for object detection but good for face detection??


VIOLA JONES ALGORITHEM -- best face detection algorithem right now!!

1			The Viola-Jones algorithm, pioneered by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in 2001, revolutionized the field of face detection. Its efficient and robust methodology opened doors to a wide range 
of applications that rely on accurately identifying and analyzing human faces. By harnessing the power of Haar-like features, integral images, machine learning, and cascades of classifiers, the Viola-Jones
algorithm showcases the synergy between computer science and image processing.
